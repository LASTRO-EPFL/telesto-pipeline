**Main_Reducing_process** is a code that will reduce images from row data to reduced, aligned and combined ones.
It does it in a following way :

- Sort the images (Flat field, Dark frames and image) in 3 different folders : images, Dark_frame, Flat_filed.
- Reduce the images by calculating the Master Dark and the Master Flat.
- Sort the reduced images by object (Chech the right ascension and the declination of each image and compare them).
	it creates 1 folder by object and fill them accordingly.
- Align all the images on one reference image (the first image of the folder "Object_X")
- Combine the images filter by filter.
- Solve the difference of resolution between then filter by applying appropriated Gaussian filters.

## REQUIREMENTS
packages:	- os
		- shutil
		- numpy (1.16.3)
		- astropy (1.0.4)
		- astroalign (1.0.4)
		- matplotlib (3.1.0)
		- scipy (1.12.0)

Initial folder :
the code "Main_Reducing_process" and the images (raw images, Dark frames, Flat fields) has to be inside
 the same folder. All the Dark frames shoul have "Dark" in their file name and all the Flat fields should have 
"FlatField" in their file name.
